# Win 95 Maze Screensaver in Rust

Win 95® screensaver-style maze in Rust with OpenGL.

Some code take from bwasty's [learn-opengl-rs](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs/).

## Compiling

Should be as easy as:

```rust
cargo install
```

And then

```rust
maze
```

or

```rust
maze --fullscreen
```

for the full experience.
